          Unfortunately, in 2022 Google unlisted the extension from the Chrome
          Web Store, and I was never able to get it listed again. Kinda
          ridiculous, but I gave up for now.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can install it manually as follows:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Clone git repo on your machine: <code>git clone https://github.com/dimonomid/geekmarks</code> (or just <a href="https://github.com/dimonomid/geekmarks/archive/refs/heads/master.zip">download zip archive</a>)</li>
          <li>Navigate to <code>chrome://extensions/</code></li>
          <li>Enable developer mode (a switch in the top-right corner)</li>
          <li>Click "Load unpacked"</li>
          <li>Select the <code>client/chrome-ext</code> directory in the repository you just cloned</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          That's it. Sorry that it's more complicated than it should be.
          I hope that at some point the extension will be restored in the
          Chrome Web Store.
        </p>

        <!--
        <p>
          I really hope that the issues with publishing to the Chrome Web Store
          will be resolved soon, so that the installation will be easier.

      <h3>Rationale</h3>

      In short, I want my bookmarking service:

      <ul>
        <li>To be very quick to use;</li>
        <li>To provide a way to organize my bookmarks in a powerful way.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
      I tried a lot of existing bookmarking services, and I wasn't satisfied by
      any of them, for a variety of reasons.
      </p>

      <p>
      Let me elaborate on the organization part first. The simplest way to
      organize bookmarks is to introduce folders to group them. This still
      poses a well-known problem though: some bookmarks can logically belong to
      multiple folders. In order to address this issue, some services use tags:
      now we can tag a bookmark with more than one tag. So far so good.
      </p>

      <p>
      Now, assume I have a generic tag <code>programming</code>, and a couple
      of more specific tags: <code>python</code> and <code>c</code>. I
      definitely want my bookmarking service to be smart enough to figure that
      if I tag some article with either <code>python</code> or <code>c</code>,
      it means programming as well; I don't want to add the tag
      <code>programming</code> manually every single time. So, what we need is
      a <i>hierarchy of tags</i>. Surprisingly enough, I failed to find a
      service which would support that.
      </p>

      <p>
      This <i>hierarchical tags</i> thing was a major motivation for me to
      start Geekmarks.
      </p>

      <p>
      Another important thing is that I want bookmarking service to be very
      quick to use. I don't want to go through these heavy user interfaces and
      look at all the eye candy. In my daily life I just want to either add a
      bookmark or find one, and I want to do that quickly: like, just a few
      keystrokes, and I'm done.
      </p>

      <p>
      And last but not least, I love open-source. So, meet Geekmarks! A free,
      open-source, API-driven bookmarking service.
      </p>

      <h3>Quick overview</h3>

      <p>
        After installing the Chrome extension, click on the "g" icon:
      </p>

      <img src="images/gm_menu_not_logged.png" class="center" />

      <p>
      Log in (via Google account), and when it's done, menu will look as
      follows:
      </p>

      <img src="images/gm_menu_logged.png" class="center" />

      <p>
      Now, on any page you want to bookmark, click "Create bookmark" from the
      menu (or use a hotkey; I personally use Shift+Ctrl+B), enter tags for
      your new bookmark, and save it. Tags which don't yet exist will be
      created on the fly.
      </p>

      <p>
      When you do that for the first time, it might look as follows:
      </p>

      <img src="images/01_something_about_python_small.gif" class="center" />

      <p>
      Later, when you have more tags, the process of adding a new bookmark
      will be faster, like this:
      </p>

      <img src="images/02_python_repl_small.gif" class="center" />

      <p>
      And this is how you find your bookmarks, after all (I use a Ctrl+B hotkey
      for that):
      </p>
